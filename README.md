### Xray_Covid19

This project aims to detect COVID-19 infection in patients using X-ray images through a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, a web interface has been developed to allow users to upload X-ray images and view the prediction results instantly. The system utilizes Flask for backend development and JavaScript for frontend interaction.

Features:

COVID-19 infection detection from X-ray images.
User-friendly web interface for image upload and result visualization.
Deep learning model trained on a large dataset for accurate predictions.
Fast and responsive web application built with Flask and JavaScript.
